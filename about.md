# About Kevin Zhijie Chen

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinchn) page is usually
more up-to-date than this page. 

I was a Software Development Manager at Amazon NYC, working on AWS [Security Hub](https://aws.amazon.com/security-hub/).
I was a Tech Lead at Google New York, working on
Google's [Data Protection](https://cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization-for-borg) infrastructure.
I got my Ph.D in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/)
at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/). I
was advised by
Prof. [Dawn Song](https://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/). My
dissertation is
titled
[Abstract Semantics for Software Security Analysis](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2015/EECS-2015-210.html). Before
coming to Berkeley, I finished my B.S. degree in Computer Science
in [Peking University](http://www.pku.edu.cn/). I did some research as
an undergraduate student at [PKU ICST](http://www.icst.pku.edu.cn/). I
am also a full member of
the [Honeynet Project](https://honeynet.org/).

In the past, I have also interned
at
[Google](https://developers.google.com/caja/),
[FireEye](http://www.fireeye.com/products-and-solutions/mobile-security.html),
and
[IBM](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_group.php?id=2720).


# Research Interests

I am interested in software security and privacy, data protection,
vulnerability discovery and program hardening.  I perform research on
security and privacy problem in mobile, web and binary programs. Most
of my research shares the theme of using formal methods and program
analysis to design and implement practical systems for vulnerability
discovery and program hardening.
